NAME
    torad.lsp - Export facility from Autocad to RADIANCE scene description.



DESCRIPTION
    Software extension for Autocad to export data to the RADIANCE light
    simulation package of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.

    Autocad entities can be selected and filtered by a series of options.

    Entities will be sorted by one of the three criteria color, layer or
    insertion layer of blocks (toplayer) according to your choice.
    The sorting results in seperate files written for every layer or color.
    Other files created optionally can contain initial material definitions
    (all identical), a list of "!cat" commands to include all the
    information to make up a complete scene description, a setup of natural
    lighting, a view description and a makefile for automatic image creation.

    Only the entities that are visible (that is their layer is on and thawed)
    will be exported, even when nested in a selected block. This gives you
    another method of filtering elements of your drawing especially usefull
    when you want to update only part of a scene.

    The layername or color number will be part of each respective filename
    to make it an unique identifier. The pipe character "|" used by Autocad
    within layernames associated with externally referenced blocks, as well
    as the dollar sign "$" are replaced by an underscore "_" as they are
    illegal or at least confusing characters for filenames on most systems.
    On Dos systems separators such as those listed above are taken out,
    the name is truncated to 6 letters and numbers are added to ensure the
    name is unique.



INSTALLATION
    Torad.lsp can be loaded after you have copied the *.lsp/bi4, torad.dcl
    and torad.mnu/x files to a location on your host which is included in
    your Autocad search path. The method to specify or modify the necessary
    environment variable ($ACAD) varies depending on the operating system.
    You will have to quit and restart any Autocad still running for the
    change to take effect.



LOADING
    Load the program by entering (load "torad[.bi4]") at the Autocad
    command prompt or automatically by activating the TORAD section in the
    screen menu area of the associated menu file.
    It is recommended to use compiled code which runs significantly faster.
    Autolisp files compiled with the compiler "acomp(.exe)" from Autodesk
    for extended Autolisp usually have the extension "*.bi4".
    The menu file associated with this program tries to load such files
    first if they are present and supported by your version of Autolisp.
    Otherwise the uncompiled lisp files are loaded.



INTERFACE
    The program is called by typing "torad" at the Autocad command prompt
    or by selecting the "EXPORT" option in the associated screen menu
    section.

    There is a dialog box for Autocad 12 or later(?) which controls all
    the necessary settings. For earlier versions the same control is
    provided by text input or a screen menu section.

    There are a number of toggles to switch on or off by entering "Yes"
    or "No" in text mode or by selecting toggle buttons in the dialog box.
    Some of the toggles affect the access to some of the others as it is
    apropiate for writing only subsets of the possible data. In such a
    case the respective prompts will be skipped or its input facilities
    in the dialog box will be greyed out and so disabled.

    The entity sampling and sampling mode options can be preset from the
    screen section of the associated menu file. They are remembered for
    the current Autocad editing session.

    The layout of the dialog box is aproximated in the following graph.

OPTIONS
    Write Filetypes:
        The following toggles and settings (upper right boxed column of the
        dialog box) specify which kind of information to export:

        Geometry information.
            This switch is on by default for it is the generic purpose
            of the program. Turning it off will disable the list of sampled
            entity types and the master control file, makefile and material
            file generation switches since they all don't make sense without.

        Master Control.
            The created file will contain all the necessary references to
            the rest of the data so that "oconv" will be satisfied with
            only this control file as its single argument.
            This and the switches for materials, viewfile and sun are off
            by default because you probably only want to use them when you
            export a complete drawing for the first time.

            Since it is not the goal of torad.lsp to make a full front end
            to the RADIANCE package it will not maintain any of these files.
            The information allready in there will be lost if you create
            them new for every update of a part of a scene description.
            In such a case you will have to edit these files manually to
            keep them up to date.

            WCS Rotation from East to X.
                If your Autocad model is not aligned geograpically (so that
                the X axis points towards east and the Y axis to north) then
                you can specify the  difference as a rotation angle around
                the Z axis in degrees here.
                This will cause the sun definition (if any) to be loaded
                with the apropriate "xform -rz ..." compensation.

            Makefile.
                The makefile will contain rules for octree conversion,
                preview with rview and batch calculation with rpict.
                Only minimal parameters are included to the commands so
                you will have to edit this file as well, be it for high
                resolution image generation or other customisations.

        Materials.
            Writes out a file of the materials. These have properties
            as assigned by AutoVision or according to the AutoCAD
            colour index (aci).

        View:
            This option enables a pop up list which contains the views
            that have been saved previously in Autocad and the current
            view. The one you select will be written to a file similar
            to those written by rview which will then contain all the
            information like viewtype, point, direction, angle and view
            up vector. View angles larger or equal than 120 degrees will
            generate a hemisperical fisheye view.
            Please note that RADIANCE clips every polygon that reaches
            behind the viewpoint.  This is often the case in parallel
            views exported from Autocad where the viewpoint may be at a
            very small offset from the world origin.

        Sun at position and time.
            This option will prompt you for the parameters of natural
            lighting as required by gensky.
            The default values are for Zurich (Switzerland) in the
            afternoon of August the 1st (This may seem exotic to you but
            not to me).


    Sampling modes.
        These settings (the lower right boxed column in the dialog box) let
        you specify the way the geometrical information will be converted.

        Sample entities by:
            Select the sorting method here out of one of the following.

            Color
                The Autocad color number as visible on the screen.
                This is the default and will help you when you organize
                your drawing "visually".

            Layer
                The layer of every subentity (the one which this entity
                is created on). Choose this method if you use a conceptual
                layering system independently from screen display colors.

            Toplayer
                As above, except for entities within blocks which will be
                treated as if beeing on the layer the block is inserted on.
                Nested blocks will end all in the same file associated with
                the layer of the outermost block.
                This can be useful if you combine the use of (unnested)
                block libraries with a seperate layer structuring system.

            The concept of floating layers and colors within (nested)
            blocks is fully supported. That means a subentity within a
            block with the layer "0" and/or the color "byblock" will
            appear on the layer and with the color of the containing block.
            This continues recursively if the block has those properties as
            well until a level with explicitly defined properties or the
            top level block is reached.  Freestanding entities with the
            color "byblock" are drawn with color nr. 7 (white).

        Segmentation per circle for arcs:
            Arc entities and arc segments of polylines have to be segmented
            for the use in RADIANCE. The value you enter here specifies
            how smooth these segments will appear in the final image.
            Higher values will make smoother surfaces. The default of 16
            is rather low but is set for reducing filesize. Make tests for
            optimized settings because the appearance of the segments will
            depend as well on the applied material as on the radius of any
            specific arc.


    Sampled Entities:
        The following switches (the left boxed row in the dialog box) let
        you specify which entity types you wish to extract from your
        drawing and what kind of surface they should display. By default
        all entities that make up a surface in Autocad (recognized by the
        hide and shade/render commands) are switched on.
        Others that just simplify modelling but are rendered differentely
        in Autocad or in RADIANCE are off and have to be enabled by the
        user explicitly.
        All polygons should keep their orientation as created in Autocad
        determined by the right hand rule as explained in the RADIANCE
        tutorial.
        Entities extruded by thickness will be inverted if their thickness
        value (or "PDSIZE" for point entities) is negative.

        The current export possibilities and their consequences are the
        following:

        Planarized faces of 3DFACEs.
            3dfaces will be split to two triangular polygons if not planar.

        Extruded and flat TRACEs.
            Traces will appear as a single polygon or as a box if the
            thickness is not zero.

        Extruded and flat SOLIDs.
            Solids will appear as a single polygon or as a box if the
            thickness is not zero.

        Extruded and flat CIRCLEs.
            Circles will appear as a ring with a inner radius of zero
            or as a cylinder/tube with a ring at either end if their
            thickness is different from zero.

        Extruded faces of ARCs.
            Arcs with a thickness different from zero will be segmented
            according to the given number of segments per full circle.

        Extruded faces of LINEs.
            Lines with a thickness different from zero will appear as a
            single polygon.

        Extruded faces of 2D-PLINEs.
            2d-polylines with a thickness different from zero will appear
            as a set of polygons.

        Constant Width of 2D-PLINEs.
            2d-polylines with a starting width different from zero set in
            their header entity (not the vertexes!) will appear as a
            polygon following the trace of the polyline with a constant
            width. This option will override the following one for poly-
            lines that match both categories (see below).
            Together with a thickness and the respective option set this
            will will result in a kind of a quadrilateral worm.

        Closed 2d-polys as POLYGONs.
            2d-polylines with the closed flag set in their header entity
            will appear as a polygon of the shape of the polyline.
            polylines with a width will not follow this rule if the
            previous option is chosen as well (see above).
            Together with a thickness and the respective option set this
            will result in a prismatic volume of the shape of the polyline.
            This option is off by default.

        Faces of 3D-MESHEs.
            The Faces of 3d-polygon meshes will appear as a set of
            polygons ignoring spline fits of any kind. Nonplanar faces
            will be split into two triangles.

        Faces of POLYFACEs.
            The faces of polyface meshes (from Autocad version 11 on) will
            appear as a set of polygons. Nonplanar faces will be split
            into two triangles. This option has no effect in environments
            older than Autocad 11.

        Points as SPHEREs or BUBBLEs.
            Point entities will appear as spheres or bubbles depending on
            either their thickness (if any) or else on the value of the
            Autocad system variable "PDSIZE". if the result is zero the
            entity is ignored.
            This option is off by default.


    Filename prefix:
        The names of all output files (excluding the makefile) will start
        with the string entered here. Default is the name of the drawing
        file. The tilde "~" in a path name will be substituted for the
        home directory ("$HOME" if present). On Dos systems a path
        can be entered here, no filename prefix is used.

    OK/Cancel buttons.
        The OK button starts the exporting after you have selected the
        entities you wish to extract. The Cancel button discards all the
        setting you have made and terminates the program.
        In the text dialog mode you can press <Control>-C to exit any time.



DETAILS
    Torad.lsp is optimized for speed and memory usage as far as possible
    without losing the functionality of sorting entities to seperate files.
    Therefore just the entity names are stored for sorting and geometry is
    ignored until later. The drawback is that entity data has to be
    extracted twice, once for sorting and once for writing (and maybe
    even more for nested blocks).

    The geometrical transformations are executed in one pass out of an
    unlimited number of nested blocks as long as no multiple inserts are
    involved.

    Error messages and alert boxes are meant to be self explanatory.

REQUIREMENTS
    Torad.lsp is meant to run with most versions of Autocad on any hardware
    Autocad runs on. Naturally, polyface meshes will not be extracted from
    version earlier than 11 drawings since they simply don't exist there.
    The dialog box control is unique to version 12 up to now. With other
    versions the setup is done by text input and the screen menu.



CAVEATS
    Please note that the AME solid modelling package by Autodesk generates
    surfaces with surface normals pointing to the inside of the created
    volumes (at least most of the times...).



BUGS
    There is no support yet for creating instances out of uniformly
    scaled blocks (RADIANCE does not support nonuniform scaling anyway).
