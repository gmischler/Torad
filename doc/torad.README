General info:
    
    torad.lsp
        
    Software extension for Autocad to export data to the RADIANCE light
    simulation package of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.

    Makes complete translation of all hiding/shading entities from
    Autocad (and some more). 

    Entities can be selected on screen for partial export.

    Entities will be sorted by one of the three criteria color, layer or
    insertion layer of blocks (toplayer) according to your choice.
    The sorting results in seperate files written for every layer or color.
    Floating layers and colors within blocks are fully supported.

    Other files created optionally can contain initial material definitions
    (all identical), a list of "!cat" commands to include all the
    information to make up a complete scene description, a setup of natural
    lighting, a view description and a makefile for automatic image creation.

    Only the entities that are visible (that is their layer is on and thawed)
    will be exported, even when nested in a selected block. This gives you
    another method of filtering elements of your drawing especially usefull
    when you want to update only part of a scene.

    The layername or color number will be part of each respective filename
    to make it an unique identifier.

    You have full control through a sreen menu section, a text dialog
    or even a interactive dialog box if you are running Autocad 12.


    Entities exported (by choice):

    Autocad entities:            radiance objects:

    - 3dfaces                    -  triangular or quadrilateral polygons.
    - extruded or flat traces    -  triangular and/or quadrilateral polygons.
    - extruded or flat solids    -  triangular and/or quadrilateral polygons.
    - extruded or flat circles   -  rings and quadrilateral polygons.
    - extruded arcs              -  quadrilateral polygons.
    - extruded lines             -  quadrilateral polygons.
    - extruded 2d-plines         -  quadrilateral polygons.
    - wide 2d-plines             -  multilateral polygons.
    - closed 2d-plines           -  multilateral polygons.
    - 3d-meshes                  -  triangular or quadrilateral polygons.
    - polyfaces                  -  triangular or quadrilateral polygons.
    - points                     -  spheres or bubbles.


    torad.lsp is optimized for speed and memory usage as far as possible
    without loosing the functionality of sorting entities to seperate files.
    If you still consider it to be too slow, you will have to rewrite it
    in C (or pay me for doing so ;-).

    But still, it really works!


    the complete program consists of eight files (up to the moment):

    Program files:
        torad.lsp       Main program source file.
        esample.lsp     Entities sampling and conversion source file.
        vector.lsp      Geometrical utilities source file.
        torad.dcl       Dialog box definition file for Autocad 12.
        torad.mnu/x     Menu file for setup with Autocad 10/11.

    Additional Files: 
        torad.man       User manual. 
        torad.README    This file. 

    All these files are packaged in both a compressed tar file and a
    zip archieve to make them easily accessible for users of each unix
    and dos systems.

"support"
    I expect the program and the manual to be self explanatory for users
    who have at least some experiance with either Autocad, Radiance or
    better both of them. If there still remain questions that cannot be
    answered neither through the manuals of Autocad, RADIANCE or torad.lsp
    nor by the local guru, you might try to reach me by mail under
    <schorsch@www.schorsch.com>.
    Be sure to notify me if you think you have found a bug in this program
    (there still might be some although thoroughly tested).
    It may happen that you will have to wait a few days for an answer since
    I am more like a guest at this site and therefore can not garantee
    to look into my mail daily.
